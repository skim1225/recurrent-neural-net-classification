# recurrent-neural-net-classification

A project which uses pytorch library to build recurrent neural networks to classify time-series data. 

Data used: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset to classify human activity from smartphone sensor data. 

This dataset contains timeseries data from smartphone sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) whileperforming daily activities.
